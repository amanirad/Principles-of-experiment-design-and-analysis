# Principles of experiment design and analysis

The current repository is for the projects of the principles of experimental design and analysis course of the first semester 1402-1403 at Sharif University of Technology. For now, the first phase of the projects is defined here that all students must do all the projects with full details in the same Jupyter Notebook R file related to that project (codes and descriptions-interpretations of the codes, as well as conclusions, should be carefully added together in that file). Note that the data for each project is also uploaded here.

The deadline for this first phase of the projects is Sunday, October 22, 2023, (30 Mehr 1402) at 11:59 PM Tehran time and will not be extended in any way.
